# Introduction

Incident Management Teams (IMT) have become an integral strategy in various regions to enhance highway system operations, particularly during peak periods when user costs and roadway congestion can escalate due to traffic incidents. These teams are adept at quickly addressing a range of incidents, from minor vehicle breakdowns to severe multi-car collisions, assisting other first response agencies in managing traffic and restoring normal conditions.

Despite the substantial benefits and increasing reliance on IMT, there is a notable gap in academic research, particularly in effectiveness studies and prospective analyses that explore the potential impacts of increased system deployment and the challenges posed by a rise in traffic incidents. This could be attributed to factors such as driver distraction, population growth, or other external influences. This research aims to fill this gap, employing a mesoscopic-simulation approach within the MATSim transportation modeling framework to represent both incidents and IMT responses in a comprehensive manner.

Implemented in a scenario representing the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City) region of Utah, our study delves into the operational dynamics of IMT, simulating various traffic incident scenarios to understand how changes in resource allocation and incident concentration can influence IMT effectiveness. Through a series of 20 simulations across three distinct scenarios, we provide a detailed comparative analysis, highlighting the potential for significant reductions in vehicle hours of delay and improvements in traffic flow consistency.

This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge on IMT, offering insights into their operational dynamics and areas for optimization. It underscores the importance of strategic IMT deployment and the necessity for continuous evaluation and adaptation of IMT strategies to meet the evolving demands of highway system operations. The paper proceeds in a typical order. A discussion of previous research into IMT motivations, effectiveness, and optimization follows this introduction. @sec-methods describes the simulation methodology and scenario construction, while @sec-results presents the results of the analysis alongside a discussion of their implications. The paper concludes in @sec-conclusion with an outline of future research motivated by this study's limitations.
