# Introduction

Many regions have introduced Incident Management Teams (IMT) as a method to improve highway system operations, especially during peak periods when the user costs of incidents clogging roadways can be particularly high. IMT can respond quickly to incidents ranging from vehicle breakdowns to serious, multi-car collisions and aid other first response agencies to manage the traffic stream and return traffic to normal conditions CITE. Some studies have suggested that IMT can save a region as much as \$X in user costs over the course of a year / peak period CITE.

In spite of the claimed benefits of IMT and the relative importance that many organizations are placing on their deployment, academic research into IMT is somewhat limited. This applies to both effectiveness studies, but especially to prospective attempts to study what effect an increase in system deployment may have, or how an increase in traffic incidents --- caused by an increase in driver distraction, population growth, or any other exogenous cause --- might strain the system deployment.

In this research, we explore a micro-simulation approach for representing IMT response to incidents in a highway network. This approach relies on adaptations to the MATSim transportation modeling framework to represent both incidents and the IMT response, and is implemented in a scenario representing the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City) region of Utah. the IMT program's performance along the Wasatch Front. The simulation aims to demonstrate how IMT effectiveness varies with changes in allocated resources as well as the concentration of incidents.

The paper proceeds in a typical order. A discussion of previous research into IMT motivations, effectiveness, and optimization follows this introduction. @sec-methods describes the simulation methodology and scenario construction, while @sec-results presents the results of the analysis alongside a discussion of their implications. The paper concludes in @sec-conclusion with an outline of future research motivated by this study's limitations.
