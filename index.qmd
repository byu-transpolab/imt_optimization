# Introduction

Incident Management Teams (IMT) are service vehicles that collaborate with highway patrol teams to manage traffic after an incident and provide timely roadside assistance. They are strategically important for improving highway operations, particularly during peak traffic times, helping to effectively alleviate congestion and associated user costs. Capable of quickly addressing a range of incidents, from minor vehicle breakdowns to severe multi-car collisions, IMT are crucial in controlling traffic and restoring normal flow on the roadways.

States like Utah have long benefited from IMT, witnessing notable reductions in congestion and traffic-related costs [@bennett2021]. The effectiveness of IMT, influenced by factors such as response times [@schultz2019], fleet size [@kim2012], and deployment locations [@ozbay2013], is well-documented. However, the current understanding primarily stems from ad-hoc models and independent initiatives, leaving a gap in regional-scale traffic delay modeling associated with incident management. 

A study conducted by @kaddoura2018 highlights the potential of large-scale traffic models to evaluate the regional impact of incidents. However, their model does not evaluate the impact of IMT strategies. This research aims to address this limitation, merging insights on IMT effectiveness with a large-scale regional traffic model. This approach is meant to highlight the impacts of traffic incidents and IMT interventions on a simulated network.

In this research we utilized the the Mutli-Agent Transportion Simulation (MATSim) to model roadway conditions along the Wasatch Front region of Utah. The model was used to evaluate IMT effectiveness within various traffic incident scenarios. After conducting 60 simulations, we compared their outcomes and evaluated the effectiveness of IMT at improving traffic conditions and reducing congestion.

This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge on IMT effectiveness and traffic incident modeling. It underscores the importance of strategic IMT deployment and the necessity for continuous evaluation and adaption of IMT strategies to meet the evolving demands of highway operation systems. The paper proceeds in a typical order. [Literature Review](#sec-literature) contains a discussion of previous research into IMT effectiveness and optimization. [Methodology](#sec-methods) describes the simulation and scenario construction, while [Results](#sec-results) presents the findings of the analysis alongside a discussion of their implications. The paper concludes in [Conclusions](#sec-conclusions) with an outline of future research motivated by this study's limitations.
