# Conclusions {#sec-conclusions}

This study aimed to model and assess the response and efficiency of IMT in the Utah Wasatch Front Region. Existing research affirms the effectiveness of IMT in alleviating the repercussions of traffic incidents and other disruptions, such as vehicle breakdowns [see @schultz; @skabardonis1998]. Furthermore, mesoscopic DTA modeling has proven to be a valuable tool for extensive studies on the impacts of incidents and incident management [see @kaddoura2018; @li2020]. However, there seems to be a research gap regarding the application of large-scale simulation models that both emulate and evaluate IMT performance. Recognizing the potential of simulation models to offer novel insights and alternative perspectives on IMT effectiveness, we deemed this area worthy of exploration. Additionally, simulation models afford the opportunity to conduct hypothetical scenario analyses, which might be impractical with the traditional methodologies used for assessing IMT performance. Motivated by these considerations, we developed an IMT simulation model to capture and represent their operational effectiveness across Utah.

Due to its cooperative open-source design, capacity for managing substantial data inputs, and potential for accurately simulating real-world behaviors, we selected the Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation (MATSim) as the platform for conducting our simulation study. Within this modeling framework, we executed simulations based on a network and plans file calibrated by @day2022, a comprehensive list of incidents compiled by @hyer2023 and the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP), IMT data supplied by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), and simulation parameters derived from the incident-based research conducted by @kaddoura2018. Furthermore, we crafted a specialized extension package for MATSim to facilitate the generation of incidents and orchestrate the IMT responses within our simulation. Upon its completion, the model was employed to conduct simulations across 60 distinct scenarios, each representing a unique combination of incident conditions and IMT configurations.

The existing incident management program in Utah is equipped with 20 IMT. This particular fleet was utilized in one-third (or 20) of our simulated scenarios and was evaluated in comparison to two other groups: a scenario without any IMT intervention and a scenario augmented with a fleet of 30 IMT. Out of the sixty scenarios conducted, half were modeled on incident frequencies derived from a sample of currently observed daily incidents. The remaining half were based on escalated incident frequencies, extracted from the higher spectrum of observed daily incidents.

In total, six distinct scenario groups were established for our analysis:

1. No IMT, with current incident frequency
2. No IMT, with increased incident frequency
3. 20 IMTs, with current incident frequency
4. 20 IMTs, with increased incident frequency
5. 30 IMTs, with current incident frequency
6. 30 IMTs, with increased incident frequency

Our hypothesis posited that an uptick in incidents would correlate with a degradation in IMT performance. Furthermore, we anticipated that a bolstered fleet of 30 IMTs would demonstrate superior efficiency in comparison to the standard 20 IMT fleet. Broadly speaking, the results from our simulation validated these hypotheses. However, it is important to note that there was a degree of variability observed within the results.

Comparisons among the scenarios were based on VHD and IMT operational measures such as average travel time, average distance traveled, and average arrival time at incidents.

## Limitations {#sec-limitations}


### Within-Day Replanning

\<\< The model was meant to incorporates the concept of within-day replanning to a certain extent, as elaborated in Chapter 30 of the MATSim textbook. I loaded the within-day replanning module but didn't specify which agents needed to use it or the times that they needed to use it. \>\>

\<\< Dr. Macfarlane. Within-day replanning is not being implemented in the way that I thought that it was. After re-reading the literature review I realized that I had confused the replanning that occurs from iteration to iteration with the replanning mentioned by @kaddoura2018 that only occurs for specific agents within the simulation. \>\>

\<\< I do think it is still worth mentioning their research, and I can discuss how we could have used within-day replanning more effectively in the limitations section of this report. I am sorry for the confusion and for not realizing the problem earlier. Perhaps this section in the Methodology could discuss the strategy the model uses from iteration to iteration. \>\>

\<\< I'll likely move this section to the limitations and talk about it, but wanted to leave you a note here just in case you were looking for this section - Daniel Jarvis\>\>
