# Literature Review {#sec-literature}

Traffic incident management in general—and IMT in particular — are not strictly new innovations. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publishes the *Traffic Incident Management Handbook* (FHWA, 2000), which defines traffic incident management as:  
*The systematic, planned, and coordinated use of human, institutional, mechanical, and technical resources to reduce the duration and impact of incidents and improve the safety of motorists, crash victims, and incident responders. (p. 1-1)*  
The handbook details the process of how to implement a traffic incident management program as well as improve it. The manual covers various aspects of incident management, including the responsibilities of emergency medical teams, law enforcement, and other responding entities. For this research, we focus on the dedicated traffic incident management teams operated by departments of transportation or similar agencies and not on other types of first responders.

FHWA has established performance measures to develop a framework to quantify improvements to IMT operations (FHWA, 2000). A specific measure related to this research is roadway clearance time (RCT): the time between the first recordable awareness of the incident and the time all lanes open for traffic flow. Numerous studies have assessed the impact of Traffic Incident Management programs on traffic conditions, utilizing the performance measures provided by FHWA. A particularly noteworthy study conducted by @schultz2019 explores the relationship between IMT response time (RT) and RCT. This research leveraged interconnected data from the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) and the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP), aiming to quantify the traffic improvements resulting from swift IMT interventions at incident sites. Analyzing 121 incidents, the study found that a one-minute delay in IMT response correlated with a 0.8-minute increase in RCT. This delay also impacted an additional 93 vehicles, added roughly 34.6 minutes to the network’s total estimated travel time, and resulted in an extra $925 in excess user costs (EUC). @schultz2019 established a clear connection between timely IMT responses and improved traffic conditions, highlighting the importance of rapid intervention.

@skabardonis1998 confirmed the effectiveness of IMT in their study, concluding that IMT in California effectively reduced incident RT and EUC. @skabardonis1998 found that, on average, total incident RT was 15 minutes longer when California Highway Patrol responded without the support of IMT. Using a system to assign a cost per traveler per unit of time to vehicles in the observed area, the authors determined that IMT units had a cost-to-benefit ratio of 5:1. They also concluded that patrol officers spent less time on incidents (including vehicle breakdowns) when assisted by IMT services.

## IMT Optimization {#sec-lit_imt_opt}

Given the evidence that IMT programs improve traffic conditions and reduce costs for government entities and individuals, it becomes crucial to further research avenues to maximize these benefits. One possible strategy is the strategic placement of IMT units, optimizing their spatial effectiveness to enhance their impact. Enhancing IMT programs often focuses on the precise deployment of individual units and the strategic positioning of IMT depots—locations where inactive teams await dispatch. For scenarios where IMT vehicles are actively on patrol, research often concerns designing an efficient service area. Various methodologies have been applied to tackle this allocation challenge. While some studies employ statistical models, incorporating a range of variables to maximize specific performance measures, others opt for digital modeling as a solution.

For instance, @ozbay2013 designed a mixed-integer programming model with probabilistic constraints to optimize the allocation of IMT across "depots" or staging areas in New Jersey. This innovative approach, grounded in known probabilities of various incident types, strategically positions IMT units to respond to incidents, taking into account future probabilities on the network. The primary goals were to minimize incident management costs and maximize the likelihood that every incident receive assistance. The model was applied to a simplified New Jersey highway network, utilizing traffic incident data from the region to inform demand distribution. Through this application, an optimal number of depots and IMT assignments were determined. However, the lack of a comparative analysis with pre-existing depot and unit distributions meant that the exact improvements yielded by the model remained unquantified.

Where @ozbay2013 focused on optimizing the IMT allocation in specific zones, others have researched their effectiveness as roaming entities. @lou2011 developed a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model and proposed different algorithms to minimize the RT of IMT. They modeled IMT within specific freeway sections, and incident frequencies were generated randomly on the network, given the mean and standard deviations of incident occurrence on each link in the network. The study focused on developing and optimizing these algorithms for broad implementation rather than focusing on any particular network or reducing response times in specific areas. They implemented a template Sioux Falls network into the model as a practical demonstration. Compared to the existing deployment plan in Sioux Falls, the algorithm-generated plans could potentially reduce total RT by 16.5-20.8%.

Each of the studies mentioned attempts to understand optimal IMT deployment based on ad-hoc models, specially constructed utility functions, or similar stand-alone efforts. While their results provide valuable insights, they might be limited in their scope, as they do not explicitly attempt to model the traffic delay associated with incident management at a large scale. Research modeling the effects of incidents on region-scale traffic networks is a recent innovation, providing a more holistic view of their impact. This approach is potentially beneficial for comprehensively assessing the effectiveness of IMT and paves the way for our subsequent discussion on Incident Modeling, where we will discuss the advancements and applications of this innovative research domain.

## Incident Modeling {#sec-inc_modeling}

The majority of traffic models used to study the impacts of incidents and incident management are Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models. These models demonstrate how congestion and travel times fluctuate over time, varying for different vehicles [@chiu2011]. The capability to represent travel time variance make DTA models particularly advantageous for depicting the unpredictability of incidents. A study conducted by @sisiopiku2007, which explored the effects of congestion, underscored the applications of simulation-based DTA modeling in incident management. It advocated for dynamic assignment as the optimal approach for incident modeling. Sisiopiku describes their methodology as follows:

> *The overall approach in this study is to use the DTA capabilities to support decision-making for incident management. DTA is particularly appropriate for studying short-term planning applications such as evaluating various incident management options (p. 111).*

In their study, Sisiopiku employed a DTA model to understand the impacts of diverse incident scenarios and to assess the effectiveness of potential incident management strategies and traffic control methods. The research commenced with a baseline scenario under standard conditions, establishing a reference point for evaluating incident impacts. Subsequent scenarios simulated incidents without notifying drivers, with variations in the duration and severity of the incidents. The final scenario replicated the previous one but incorporated information provision to drivers, enabling them to optimize their routes and access preplanned diversion paths, with guidance from Variable Message Signs. Conducted in Birmingham and Chicago, the study illustrated that post-incident information provision could result in travel time savings and reduced traffic delays, highlighting the DTA model’s utility in simulating the effects of incidents and evaluating traffic management and control strategies.

@sisiopiku2007 study utilized the Visual Interactive System for Transport Algorithms (VISTA) as their specific modeling tool. Despite its efficacy, VISTA was critiqued by @wirtz2005 for its inherent assumption that all drivers have perfect travel time information for routing to the optimal path. For example, Sisiopiku’s study assumed a 100% compliance rate with the provided diversion routes in their model. However, Wirtz’s research revealed that “less-informed drivers spend more time traveling than necessary, representing a departure from the user-optimal traffic conditions simulated by VISTA.” This critique does not invalidate Sisiopiku’s findings but highlights the limitations of VISTA in reflecting real-world travel behavior.

VISTA is categorized as a large-scale, or mesoscopic, model suitable for modeling extensive networks. Conversely, small-scale, or microscopic, models, capable of tracking precise vehicle locations, driver behavior, and vehicle characteristics, offer a highly realistic representation but are impractical for large regions [@chiu2011]. In Australia, @dia2006 utilized the Visual Simulation Model (VISSIM) to assess the impacts of incident management on two arterial routes connecting the western suburbs of Brisbane to the Central Business District. Although VISSIM is a primary traffic modeling tool for UDOT, its detailed precision renders it impractical for modeling incidents and IMT impacts along the Utah Wasatch Front. Given this research’s scope, a large-scale dynamic model would likely be the most suitable choice.

Interestingly, @pal2002 developed a model to replicate the impacts of incidents and IMT on traffic conditions in Indiana utilizing overall traffic  conditions as the performance indicator for IMT effectiveness. Various configurations of response vehicles were simulated, incorporating probability distributions of crash data, vehicle speed, and roadway carrying capacity. The study’s results informed recommendations on fleet size, operation hours, patrol area design, and dispatching policy improvements. However, since mesoscopic traffic simulations in 2002 could not simulate incident response units, @pal2002 had to create their model from scratch. Unfortunately, their model and methodology seem tailored specifically for their study and may not be applicable to this project’s context.

Similar to VISTA, MATSim, the Multi Agent Transport Simulation toolkit, stands as another large-scale modeling system that has proven effective in conducting large-scale incident simulations. While VISTA and MATSim both have the capability to simulate the regional impact of traffic incidents, MATSim presents attributes that could potentially offer a more accurate representation of real-world scenarios and driver behaviors. Also, contrary to the model crafted by @pal2002, MATSim operates as an open-source framework, making it ideal for adapting to different scenarios. Notably, MATSim facilitates the integration of real world data, enhancing the authenticity and precision of network simulations. This capability is particularly pertinent to this project, as prior research conducted by @hyer2023 has made recent UDOT incident and IMT data available, which could be integrated into the simulation model for more robust and realistic results. Although MATSim has been employed to assess network impacts of incidents, its application in incident management studies remains largely unexplored, presenting an opportunity for further investigation and potential breakthroughs in the field.

@kaddoura2018 conducted a comprehensive study on incident modeling using MATSim, representing transport users as individual agents within an iterative framework that allows for adjustments to travel plans both within and between iterations. They accessed incident data, including Traffic Message Channel (TMC) information detailing cause and severity, via the HERE application programming interface. This rich dataset enabled the classification of incidents as either long-term, such as multiple-day lane closures, or short-term, affecting transport supply for less than a day. Applying their model to an inner-city network in Berlin, Germany, @fig-berlin_cap illustrates the modeled incident severities.

![Traffic incidents mapped on the Berlin network [@kaddoura2018].](figures/berlin_capacity.png){#fig-berlin_cap}

@kaddoura2018 found that long-term traffic incidents increase traffic congestion and the average car travel time by 313 sec (+18%) per trip. Short-term traffic incidents increase the average travel time per car trip by another 136 sec (+8%). Additionally, they found that for 44% of all car trips, the agent’s transport route contained at least one road segment for which the capacity or speed limit was reduced because of an incident. Their study concluded that networks in which transport users had high levels of knowledge about the incidents and resulting traffic congestion still experienced an increase in travel time caused by long and short-term incidents. Finally, Kaddoura and Nagel asserted that “accounting for traffic incidents makes the model more realistic, allowing for an improved policy investigation” [@kaddoura2018, p. 885]. The modeling performed by Kaddoura and Nagel is just one example of research on MATSim’s capacity for incident-based simulations.

A MATSim incidents model developed by @li2020 included various rescheduling options, such as departure time, mode choice, and trip cancellation. Their simulation found that if travelers received notice of an incident, they would either depart early from their place of origin or switch to public transport [@li2020]. The process proposed by Li and Ferguson is beneficial because it allows agents to reassess their mode choice or route assignment based on the notice of a reported incident. Li and Ferguson show that users care about total travel time and travel time variability (risk tolerance to a certain degree). Receiving notifications about incidents by agents impacted both travel time and mode choice. They concluded that “the provision of real-time traffic information is a useful approach to mitigating the side-effects of incidents through helping transport users efficiently adapt their day plans” [@li2020, p. 96]. Additionally, they found that “most of the travelers notified of being affected by incidents are simulated to depart early or switch to public transport, which effectively reduces the average travel time delay caused by disruptions” [@li2020, p. 96]. Their findings validate the conclusions of @sisiopiku2007 that making incident information available to agents leads to decreases in travel time and congestion.

This subsection highlights the capabilities of DTA models to simulate the complexities of traffic incidents, congestion, and travel times. It highlights how incorporating incident management responses into the models would enhance their ability to simulate realistic traffic conditions and support policy analysis. Given its capacity to model large-scale networks, integrate real-world data, and replicate realistic driver behavior, MATSim is deemed particularly suitable for this project.

## Summary {#sec-lit_summary}

This [literature review](#sec-literature) provides an overview of the extensive research on the effectiveness of IMT in reducing RCT and EUC during incident responses. It has also highlighted studies focused on optimizing the size and distribution of IMT. However, these studies do not include the broader implications of incidents and IMT responses on large-scale networks and their agents. On the other hand, while DTA modeling studies have effectively explored the impact of incidents on network dynamics and driver behavior, they largely have not examined the influence of IMT. This creates a research gap in understanding the effectiveness of IMT and the impact of incidents on congested networks. Bridging this gap is crucial, as it enables researchers to better grasp how alterations in incident occurrence or IMT availability might influence overall traffic conditions. In our research, we aim to merge these two areas of study, attempting to model incident response within a simulation framework, thereby broadening the scope for evaluating IMT deployment strategies and their effectiveness.
