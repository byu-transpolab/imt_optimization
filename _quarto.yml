  abstract: |
    The abstract is a crucial component of any scientific paper, as it 
    provides a summary of the research and its main findings. This paper 
    provides guidelines for writing an effective scientific abstract. 
    The first step is to identify the key elements of the research, such 
    as the research question, methods, results, and conclusions. Next, 
    the abstract should be written in a clear and concise manner, using 
    simple language and avoiding technical jargon. The abstract should 
    also be structured, with a clear introduction, methods section, results 
    section, and conclusion. Additionally, the abstract should accurately 
    and succinctly convey the main findings of the research, highlighting the 
    significance and implications of the work. By following these 
    guidelines, researchers can ensure that their abstract effectively communicates 
    the key aspects of their research and attracts the attention of potential 
    readers. - Written by ChatGPT

acknowledgments: | 
  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Utah Department of Transportation for their generous financial support, which was instrumental in bringing this research and thesis project to fruition. My heartfelt thanks also go to the technical advisory committee, whose guidance and constructive feedback have been invaluable throughout the course of this research. Their deep insights into Utah’s traffic incident management programs played a crucial role in shaping this work.
  I am also immensely grateful to my fellow research assistants at BYU, Joel Hyer, Harrison Holdsworth, and Brynn Woolley. Joel, through his work on the IMT Performance Phase III project, provided essential information on IMT performance, as well as incident data and metrics, all of which were pivotal to this project. Harrison’s contributions were multifaceted; he not only compiled research on IMT optimization, but also assisted in writing the literature review for this report and served as a vital link between Joel’s project and my own research. Brynn’s expertise was invaluable in the development of the transportation model used in this project, and her assistance in analyzing its outputs, as well as her help in the production and editing of this thesis document, were greatly appreciated.
  I want to express my profound appreciation to my faculty advisors and the members of the thesis committee, Drs. Macfarlane, Schultz, and Williams. Special gratitude is extended to Dr. Macfarlane, whose role as an outstanding faculty advisor, teacher, mentor, and friend has been invaluable throughout my academic journey. His patience, counsel, and support have been crucial at every phase of this project. I am deeply thankful for his belief in my potential and his consistent encouragement, which have been instrumental in my personal growth and the success of this research.
