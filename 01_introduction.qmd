# Introduction

In many regions, such as Utah, efforts have been made to mitigate non-recurring congestion - traffic prompted by incidental occurrences like vehicle crashes, spills, or breakdowns rather than typical congestion caused by travel demand. These strategies often involve the deployment of an Incident Management Team (IMT), a specialized crew from the Department of Transportation equipt with the necessary tools and materials to promptly address these unexpected incidents. These IMTs are one element within a broader field of Traffic Incident Management (TIM) practices adopted by transportation and public safety agencies. Previous and ongoing research at Brigham Young University (BYU) concluded that rapid IMT deployment following an incident would significantly reduce excess user costs caused by congestion due to these incidents [@schultz2019].

In 2019, the Utah state legislature allocated funds to enhance the reach and availability of the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) IMT program. In coordination with the existing Highway Patrol program and dispatch service, this planned expansion anticipates deploying more teams across a wider array of locations, potentially extending beyond the Wasatch Front. As the program grows, it naturally raises crucial questions about these teams' strategic placement. Deciding on the most effective locations is crucial for maximizing their availability and efficiency in mitigating incidents along the state's most critical transportation corridors.

Given this context, the primary objective of this paper is to explore a micro-simulation approach for assessing the IMT program's performance along the Wasatch Front. Drawing on prior research, we will utilize a model representing the region's average daily traffic while developing innovative methods to simulate capacity-reducing incidents. The study will then analyze how IMT units respond to these incidents and estimate the subsequent reduction in simulated delay. Through this research, we aim to identify the optimal number of IMT vehicles and their strategic staging locations to minimize user delay across various incident scenarios.

The report proceeds in several chapters as described below:

1.  Introduction: This introductory chapter.
2.  Literature Review: An overview of previous efforts to evaluate IMT effectiveness and model delay due to non-recurring congestion.
3.  Methodology: A description of the techniques developed to represent IMT in a simulation engine and develop evaluation scenarios.
4.  Results and Analysis: A detailed analysis of the evaluation scenarios.
5.  Conclusion: A summary of findings from the research including recommendations for UDOT.
