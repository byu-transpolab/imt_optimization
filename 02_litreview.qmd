# Literature Review {#sec-literature}

Traffic incident management in general—and IMT in particular—are not strictly new innovations. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publishes the *Traffic Incident Management Handbook* (FHWA, 2000), which defines traffic incident management as:

> *The systematic, planned, and coordinated use of human, institutional, mechanical, and technical resources to reduce the duration and impact of incidents and improve the safety of motorists, crash victims, and incident responders. (p. 1-1)*

The handbook details the process of how to implement a traffic incident management program as well as improve it. The manual covers various aspects of incident management, including the responsibilities of emergency medical teams, law enforcement, and other responding entities. For this research, we focus on the dedicated traffic incident management teams operated by departments of transportation or similar agencies and not on other types of first responders.

FHWA has established performance measures to develop a framework to quantify improvements to IMT operations and traffic (FHWA, 2000). A specific measure related to this research is roadway clearance time (RCT): the time between the first recordable awareness of the incident and the time all lanes open for traffic flow. Numerous studies have assessed the impact of Traffic Incident Management programs on traffic conditions, utilizing the performance measures provided by FHWA. A particularly noteworthy study conducted by @schultz2019 explores the relationship between IMT response time (RT) and RCT. This research leveraged interconnected data from the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) and the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP), aiming to quantify the traffic improvements resulting from swift IMT interventions at incident sites. Analyzing 121 incidents, the study found that a one-minute delay in IMT response correlated with a 0.8-minute increase in RCT. This delay also impacted an additional 93 vehicles, added roughly 34.6 minutes to the network's total estimated travel time, and resulted in an extra $925 in excess user costs (ECU). @schultz2019 established a clear connection between timely IMT responses and improved traffic conditions, underscoring the importance of rapid intervention.

@skabardonis1998 confirmed the effectiveness of IMT in their study, concluding that IMT in California effectively reduced incident RT and ECU. @skabardonis1998 found that, on average, total incident RT was 15 minutes longer when California Highway Patrol (CHP) responded without the support of IMT. Using a system to assign a cost per traveler per unit of time to vehicles in the observed area, the authors determined that IMT units had a cost-to-benefit ratio of 5:1. They also concluded that CHP officers spent less time on incidents (including vehicle breakdowns) when assisted by IMT services.

## IMT Optimization

Given the evidence that IMT programs improve traffic conditions and reduce costs for government entities and individuals, it becomes paramount to further research avenues to maximize these benefits. One possible strategy is the strategic placement of IMT units, optimizing their spatial effectiveness to enhance their impact. Enhancing IMT programs often focuses on the precise deployment of individual trucks and the strategic positioning of IMT depots—locations where inactive trucks await dispatch. For scenarios where IMT vehicles are actively on patrol, research often concerns designing an efficient service area. Various methodologies have been applied to tackle this allocation challenge. While some studies employ statistical models, incorporating a range of variables to maximize specific performance measures given constraints, others opt for digital modeling as a solution.

For instance, @ozbay2013 designed a mixed-integer programming model with probabilistic constraints to optimize the allocation of IMT across "depots" or staging areas in New Jersey. This innovative approach, grounded in known probabilities of various incident types, strategically positions IMT units to respond to incidents, taking into account future probabilities on the network. The primary goals were to minimize incident management costs and maximize the likelihood that every incident receive assistance. The model was applied to a simplified South Jersey Highway network, utilizing traffic incident data from the region to inform demand distribution. Through this application, an optimal number of depots and truck assignments were determined. However, the lack of a comparative analysis with pre-existing depot and unit distributions meant that the exact improvements yielded by the model remained unquantified.

Where @ozbay2013 focused on optimizing the IMT allocation in specific zones, others have researched their effectiveness as roaming entities. @lou2011 developed a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model and proposed different algorithms to minimize the RT of IMT. They modeled IMT within specific freeway sections, and incident frequencies were generated randomly on the network, given the mean and standard deviations of incident occurrence on each link in the network. The study focused on developing and optimizing these algorithms for broad implementation rather than focusing on any particular network or reducing response times in specific areas. They implemented a template Sioux Falls network into the model as a practical demonstration. Compared to the existing deployment plan in Sioux Falls, the algorithm-generated plans could potentially reduce total RT by 16.5-20.8%.

Each of the studies mentioned attempts to understand optimal IMT deployment based on ad-hoc models, specially constructed utility functions, or similar stand-alone efforts. While their results provide valuable insights, they might be limited in their scope, as they do not explicitly attempt to model the traffic delay associated with incident management at a large scale. Research modeling the effects of incidents on region-scale traffic networks is a recent innovation, providing a more holistic view of the impact. This approach is potentially beneficial for comprehensively assessing the effectiveness of IMT and paves the way for our subsequent discussion on Incident Modeling, where we will discuss the advancements and applications of this innovative research domain.

## Incident Modeling

As outlined in the preceding section, previous attempts to understand optimal IMT deployment have been primarily based on ad-hoc models, specially constructed utility functions, or similar stand-alone efforts. Rarely has there been an explicit attempt to model traffic delay associated with incident management, at least partially because research modeling the effects of incidents on region-scale traffic networks is a recent innovation.

Traffic models are based on static assignment, dynamic assignment, or sometimes a combination of both. Static traffic assignment (STA) and dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) make the same behavioral assumption: drivers want to reach their destination in the shortest time possible. A static model achieves optimization by calculating route travel times, finding the shortest path, and adjusting routes toward equilibrium. The issue with static models is that they assume that all vehicles experience the same delay -- in particular, traffic flow is anisotropic and obeys causality [@boyles2018].

Dynamic modeling also aims to achieve equilibrium through route choice. Dynamic modeling shows how congestion varies over time, and it bases equilibration on experienced travel times, not instantaneous travel times. According to @boyles2018, "DTA is best applied when the input data are known with high certainty, only a few scenarios are needed, and detailed congestion and queueing information are critical" [@boyles2018 p. 28]. A study on the effects of congestion conducted by @sisiopiku2007 highlighted the applications of simulation-based DTA modeling on incident management. Her study argues that dynamic assignment is preferred over static when considering incident modeling. Sisiopiku describes her methodology as follows:

> *The overall approach in this study is to use the DTA capabilities to support decision-making for incident management. Unlike static assignment methods, which are based on average daily traffic and fail to capture the dynamic process of an incident, DTA is particularly appropriate for studying short-term planning applications such as evaluating various incident management options (p. 111).*

In this study, Sisiopiku used a simulation-based DTA model to assess the impacts of designed incident scenarios. She evaluated the effectiveness of candidate incident management plans and the impacts of traffic operations and control strategies for the analysis period.

Sisiopiku initially conducted a base scenario under non-incidental conditions, which served as a benchmark for comparison. The follow-up scenario introduced an incident simulation, with the key caveat that drivers were kept uninformed about the incident. The duration and severity of the incidents were manipulated between different iterations of this second scenario. The third scenario mirrored the second but introduced information provision to the drivers. In this scenario, drivers were empowered to optimize their route through the incident zone and given access to information about pre-planned diversion paths. This information was relayed to the drivers through Variable Message Signs (VMS) strategically positioned upstream of decision points, as detailed in Sisiopiku's 2007 study.

The scenarios Sisopiku ran in Birmingham and Chicago revealed that travel time savings and traffic delay reduction could be achieved if information was provided to the agents following an incident. The study also shows how a simulation-based DTA model can simulate the impact of incidents on congestion and the impacts of different traffic operation and control strategies. The DTA tool Sisiopiku uses is Visual Interactive System for Transport Algorithms or VISTA, a tool commonly used in traffic modeling.

Echoing Sisiopiku's usage of VISTA, @wirtz2005 also undertook an in-depth analysis of this tool in his 2005 traffic incident simulation study. Wirtz elaborated on the limitations of both VISTA and DTA systems. As part of their route adjustment towards equilibrium, these systems presume all drivers possess flawless travel time information for routing to the user-optimal path. For instance, Sisiopiku, in her 2007 study, presumed a 100% compliance rate for the diversion routes provided to the drivers in her model. The validity of this assumption of perfect travel time information is partially contingent on the communication medium---radio traffic reports, the internet, or VMS. Wirtz's 2005 study revealed that "less-informed drivers spend more time traveling than necessary, representing a departure from the user-optimal traffic conditions simulated by VISTA." With the advancements in personal GPS information and its increased accessibility, drivers are more likely to identify an optimal path post-incident. It is critical to acknowledge that the assumptions embedded in a model, along with its scope and scale, significantly influence its functionality.

DTA models generally fall into two camps: microscopic and mesoscopic. Microscopic models run on small scales and track the trajectories of individuals. In contrast, mesoscopic models are more aggregated and simplify variations in behavior; they involve elements of both static modeling and dynamic microscopic models [@boyles2018]. The level of detail in microscopic models makes them highly realistic but impractical for modeling large regions. A mesoscopic model that shows the paths of individual vehicles but ignores traffic flow issues like turn conflicts and lane changes would work well for modeling traffic flow over a greater area [@boyles2018].

VISTA is an example of a mesoscopic model which showcases DTA's capability for incident modeling. Microscopic models, like VISSIM, can also be used for incident modeling. Microscopic models can track precise locations of vehicles, driver behavior, and even vehicle characteristics; this makes the models extraordinarily realistic but impractical for modeling large regions [@boyles2018]. In Australia, @dia2006 used VISSIM to evaluate incident management impacts on two arterial routes (Coronation Drive and Milton Road) connecting the western suburbs of Brisbane and the Central Business District. Another framework used for incident modeling is the traffic simulator JDSMART. This model was used by @vanlint2012 for incident simulation and to study how roadway policies influence congestion.

MATSim, the Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Toolkit, has recently gained recognition as a helpful software for incident modeling, demonstrating a capacity for producing microscopic and mesoscopic models. Operating as an open-source framework, MATSim is designed to implement large-scale agent-based transport simulations. Using a mesoscopic queue-based strategy, agents representing individuals seek the shortest routes connecting their activities.

In his 2016 chapter of the MATSim manual, @dobler2016 emphasized the necessity and application of a within-day replanning tool within the MATSim context. He elaborated that while MATSim's iterative modeling approach fares well under ideal conditions and in achieving user equilibrium, it falls short when dealing with unexpected occurrences. This deficiency manifests as illogical behavior, such as preemptive route changes before the incident's actual occurrence. For example, Figure 1 illustrates a MATSim routing problem featuring within-day replanning. It depicts an agent (a simulated individual) navigating from the red dot to the green dot. A crash ensues along the agent's assigned route at 14:02. Due to the iterative approach; however, the agent switches to a different route at 14:00, two minutes before the crash. This inconsistency exposes the limitations of an iterative approach in modeling unanticipated behavior, underscoring the need for a within-day replanning method, which utilizes a single iteration for replanning rather than multiple.

![Within-day replanning approach for a MATSim routing problem.](figures/within_day.png)

While iterative systems leverage best-response modules, within-day systems necessitate using a best-guess module. This approach means that travel times can be optimized to a stable state with an iterative approach, but this is not the case with a within-day approach. An inherent attribute of within-day replanning is that it does not converge to a user equilibrium, unlike an iterative process. Decisions, appearing optimal in the moment, often reveal themselves as suboptimal upon retrospective evaluation. Given the limited information available to the agents in a within-day system, they may not necessarily choose the path with the shortest travel time post-incident, as discussed by Dobler in 2016.

Replanning contains two categories: replanning an element of the activity and executing the replanned elements. Elements include the trip's start and end times, location, route, mode choice, or dropping of a trip entirely. The system can execute plans for in-the-moment events or those performed in the future. In a presently performed procedure, we cannot conduct all replanning actions (e.g., we can no longer alter the start time of an activity or the transport mode of a trip currently being performed) [@dobler2016]. Figure 2: Iterative and within-day replanning MATSim loop illustrates where within-day replanning fits within a MATSim loop.

![Iterative and within-day replanning MATSim loop.](figures/matsim_loop.png)

An alternative to iterative or within-day replanning only approaches is to combine them. For example, we cannot thoroughly plan situations like parking or car-sharing, requiring iterative and within-day replanning methods. An agent can arrange a parking activity but cannot predict which parking spots will be available when they arrive. Thus, we use within-day replanning when the agent starts their parking choice.

In general, within-day or en-route replanning means that travelers replan during the day or on their route, meaning that the simulation needs to influence the agent while the network runs. @dobler2016 explains that we influence agents' decisions through loops or by having users' routes dependent on the next link they choose. Because going through all links and nodes at every step would be computationally challenging, we may set certain links to be non-active and removed from the computation [@dobler2016]. The two implementation methods Dobler described are plan-based implementation and replacing the agent.

In a plan-based implementation, a loop is used where each agent can deliberate in every time step. The agent can decide that they have nothing to deliberate and return immediately. Because the number of links is typically much smaller than the number of agents in a scenario, massive optimization is necessary to make the loop computationally efficient. For this reason, we could ask each agent to choose a link only when they need to decide.

Such event-driven planning requires the agents to be re-programmed to have enough capabilities to be oriented about themselves (i.e., be able to compute plausible routes). Agents will only need to perform such computation when replanning is triggered by an event like an emergency warning or unexpected congestion; otherwise, they will follow their usual daily plans.

Re-programing agents and implementing within-day replanning, as shown in Figure 2: Iterative and within-day replanning MATSim loop., requires the implantation of a *MobsimEngine*, which can be plugged into the mobility simulator seen in the execution phase of Figure 2: Iterative and within-day replanning MATSim loop [@axhausen2016]. @dobler2016 describes it this way, "in every simulated time step, the QSim iterates over all registered *MobsimEngines* and allows them to simulate the current time step. Besides simulation of the traffic flows, those engines can also let agents start or end activities" [@dobler2016 p. 193]. The engines contain within-day replanning logic called *WithinDayEngine*, which helps track agents and adapt their plans [@dobler2016]. Not all agents need to compute plausible routes at every turn, so an *AgentSelector* selects the agents to be replanned. *AgentFilters* assist them in narrowing the search population [@dobler2016]. Lastly, *TravelTimeCollectors* are part of the *WithinDayEngine* and provide actual link travel times to the replanners by collecting and averaging travel times of agents that have recently passed a link during a given time [@dobler2016]. The elements described above make up the plan-based system.

A significant incident modeling, plan-based system study used MATSim to simulate traffic incidents [@kaddoura2018]. Their research explains that MATSim models transport users as individual agents. MATSim is iterative and allows users to adjust travel plans during a single iteration, from iteration to iteration, or both [@kaddoura2018]. Kaddoura and Nagel accessed their incident data via the HERE application programming interface for traffic incidents. This incident data included Traffic Message Channel (TMC) information indicating an incident's cause and severity. With such robust data, Kaddoura and Nagel could categorize incidents as long or short-term and model each accordingly in MATSim. Long-term effects include multiple-day lane closures, whereas short-term incidents affect transport supply for less than a day. Their simulation was based on an inner-city network in Berlin, Germany. Figure 3: Traffic incidents mapped on the Berlin network illustrates the type of incidents modeled and their severity. In this example, a crash on the southern inner-city motorway ring road led to a full road closure, and several construction sites caused partial capacity reductions.

![Traffic incidents mapped on the Berlin network.](figures/berlin_capacity.png)

@kaddoura2018 found that long-term traffic incidents increase traffic congestion and the average car travel time by 313 sec (+18%) per trip. Short-term traffic incidents increase the average travel time per car trip by another 136 sec (+8%). Additionally, they found that for 44% of all car trips, the agent's transport route contained at least one road segment for which the capacity or speed limit was reduced because of an incident. Their study concluded that networks in which transport users had high levels of knowledge about the incidents and resulting traffic congestion still experienced an increase in travel time caused by long and short-term incidents. Finally, Kaddoura and Nagel asserted that "accounting for traffic incidents makes the model more realistic, allowing for an improved policy investigation" [@kaddoura2018 p.885]. The modeling performed by Kaddoura and Nagel is just one example of research on MATSim's capacity for incident-based simulations.

A MATSim model developed by @li2020 included various rescheduling options, such as departure time, mode choice, and trip cancellation. Their simulation found that if travelers received notice of an incident, they would either depart early from their place of origin or switch to public transport [@li2020]. The process proposed by Li and Ferguson is beneficial because it allows agents to reassess their mode choice or route assignment based on the notice of a reported incident. Li and Ferguson show that users care about total travel time and travel time variability (risk tolerance to a certain degree). The receiving of notifications about incidents by agents impacted both factors. They concluded that "the provision of real-time traffic information is a useful approach to mitigating the side-effects of incidents through helping transport users efficiently adapt their day plans" [@li2020 p.96].

Additionally, they found that "most of the travelers notified of being affected by incidents are simulated to depart early or switch to public transport, which effectively reduces the average travel time delay caused by disruptions" [@li2020 p.96]. Their findings validate the conclusions of @sisiopiku2007 that making incident information available to agents leads to decreases in travel time and congestion. Like the studies already mentioned, there have been various modifications to and research on MATSim and its capacity.

In Thailand's capital, Bangkok, a study conducted by @peungnumsai2019 demonstrated the potency of the MATSim framework in portraying the impact of rush hour congestion on select traffic links. Peungnumsai ran various simulation iterations, loading the selected links with a different number of agents: 10, 100, and 500. The data collected and the subsequent analysis substantiated MATSim's capability to demonstrate the congestion-induced variations in travel time. Furthermore, it was observed that as the number of agents in the simulation increased, there was a proportional surge in computing time, physical memory usage, and the size of the output file. Despite the scale of these simulations being relatively small, MATSim has the capacity to simulate up to 10-100 million agents, encompassing various modes of transportation like bicycles, motorbikes, cars, buses, and taxis [@peungnumsai2019].

In a contrasting study conducted in Copenhagen, Denmark, @paulsen2018 utilized MATSim to contrast the reliability of automobile and railway travel times. His methodology involved using an extension of MATSim centered around an event-based public transport router, which facilitates optimal route selection for public transport users by comparing the effectiveness of routes over several iterations. Paulsen's simulation of travel times for both cars and trains yielded an interesting finding: passenger delays were significantly influenced by the adaptiveness of their chosen routes. However, he noted that passenger travel times tended to be more unpredictable than trains, which escalated with the degree of route adaptiveness. He concluded that the adaptiveness of route selection contributed to significant travel time fluctuations, a conclusion that aligns with the findings of @li2020.

In essence, the studies encapsulated in Section 2.2 validate the effectiveness of the open-source software MATSim, in simulating traffic incidents, congestion, and travel times. This evidence accentuates how the proper application of MATSim or similar Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models can account for traffic incidents, thereby enhancing the realism of the models. This type of model, in turn, can facilitate more effective policy investigation, as noted by @kaddoura2018.

## Summary

As explained in this section, there has been extensive research into IMT's effectiveness and ability to restore traffic flow following long- and short-term disturbances. Additionally, several studies have examined how to effectively model traffic incidents and show their impact on travel time, congestion, and mode choice. However, in these vast arrays of findings, there is a gap in research on modeling IMT effectiveness and incident impact on a loaded network with realistic agents. As a result, it is difficult for researchers to understand how changes to incident generation or IMT availability may impact traffic conditions. In this research, we seek to combine these two strands, attempting to model incident response in a mesoscopic simulation framework to bring realism and detail to the IMT deployment question.
