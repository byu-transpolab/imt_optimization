As highlighted in the [literature review](#sec-literature), there is substantial evidence indicating that IMT can effectively reduce RCT and EUC following traffic incidents. Additionally, the effectiveness of DTA models in analyzing the impact of such incidents has been well-documented. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research evaluating IMT impact on entire traffic networks and their associated agents. To address this gap, it is necessary that we develop a model capable of simulating both traffic incidents and the ensuing IMT interventions, with the objective of gauging the efficiency of IMT deployments. Due to its proficiency in regional-scale incident simulation and its authentic portrayal of driver behavior, MATSim has been identified as the most suitable model for this research. This section describes the methodology, expounding on the model's capabilities, the requisite data inputs, and the benchmarks established for determining IMT effectiveness.

Our methodology is structured around three main components: the functionality of the MATSim model, the setup of IMT vehicles and incidents, and the scenarios for comparative analysis. In the [model design](#sec-MATSim_mod) subsection we describe the structure of the model and the functions it uses to represent incidents and IMT response. In [model implementaiton](#sec-model_imp) we outline the data structure of the model by describing the [setup of IMT](#sec-IMT_setup) and explaining our [incident data and sampling](#sec-inc_data) methods. We conclude by describing the [scenarios](#sec-scenarios) we used for evaluating the impact of incidents and IMT.

## Model Design {#sec-MATSim_mod}

MATSim is an open-source framework used for conducting extensive, agent-based transportation simulations on a large scale. Operating as a dynamic traffic simulation, it is often used in demand modeling and agent-based mobility analysis [@dobler2016]. Thanks to its open-source architecture, MATSim enables the seamless integration of a diverse array of modules and packages into its models. Users across the platform can create, import, and modify these components, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.

For the purposes of our research, we developed the ImtModule, a specialized MATSim extension designed to process incidents and IMT responses within the simulation. This module leverages existing research on incident simulation, Demand Rapid Transit (DRT), event handling, and vehicle dispatch algorithms, building upon these foundations to enhance the functionality of our model.

In this section, we describe some of the specific tools within MATSim that we used and adapted to construct a comprehensive and functional model. These tools include [scoring and replanning](#sec-MATSim_score), [network change events](#sec-NCE), and [IMT assignment and response](#sec-imt_response). Together, they contribute to the realism and precision of our traffic simulations, particularly in the context of responding to roadway incidents, ensuring that our model provides accurate and reliable results.

### Scoring and Replanning {#sec-MATSim_Score}

In MATSim, each individual within the simulation is called an agent. These agents follow daily schedules, partaking in various activities and modes of travel. Their actions are evaluated using a point system, which takes into account the specifics of their travel, as highlighted by @nagel2016. Timely arrivals at destinations are rewarded with positive points, whereas delays result in deductions. Furthermore, different transportation modes are assigned utility scores, which play a crucial role in shaping the agents' travel preferences and decisions.

Each agent possesses a memory that stores plans from a certain number of iterations, as well as replanning strategies that dictate how agents can adjust their plans from iteration to iteration @horni2016. The size of an agent's memory is typically dependent on the size of the model being run. In the case of our large-scale Utah model, we opted to limit the agents' plan memory to just five iterations. The replanning strategies used include selecting the plan with the highest score 80% of the time, opting to reroute 10% of the time, and adjusting activity timings for the remaining 10%. Our selection for the remaining scoring and replanning parameters drew from the incident research conducted by @kaddoura2018.

The replanning strategies used include selecting the plan with the highest score 80% of the time, opting to reroute 10% of the time, and adjusting activity timings for the remaining 10%. The remaining scoring and replanning parameters were primarily selected based on insights from the incident research conducted @kaddoura2018 and the parameters used in their model.

As will be detailed in the [model implementaiton](#sec-model_imp) section, the plans file used to generate simulations in MATSim was exceptionally large, encompassing travel data for over 2 million agents. Our objective, utilizing the complete plans file, was to guide the simulated agents toward an equilibrium in travel behavior. To achieve this, we employed the following methodology:

1.  We processed both the network and plans files over the course of 350 simulated iterations with incidents or IMT included.
2.  Using the output from this preliminary scenario, we established a 'hot start' for the subsequent scenarios incorporating incidents and IMT responses. At this stage, a significant portion of agents had already identified efficient travel routes to their destinations. This preliminary phase of running the plans file was intended to expedite the convergence towards a balanced state in travel behavior for scenarios that included incidents and IMT responses.
3.  To achieve equilibrium in travel behavior, we conducted an additional 100 iterations in the simulations that accounted for incidents and IMT responses, ensuring a more comprehensive stabilization across the majority of scenarios.

@fig-score_output illustrates a MATSim scoring output from a scenario that included incidents and IMT. This figure shows that there were significant adjustments to plans and corresponding scores during the initial 60 iterations, with the system's exEUCted scores gradually stabilizing as the simulation neared its completion.

### Network Change Events {#sec-NCE}

Within a MATSim network, each link is characterized by specific attributes such as type, length, number of lanes, free-flow speed, and capacity. To effectively simulate unexpected events and their subsequent impacts on traffic flow, it is essential to dynamically adjust these attributes. This capability, termed a Time-Dependent Network, is explained in the MATSim textbook [@rieser2016] and is vital for ensuring the realism and accuracy of our simulation.

Network Change Events (NCE) serve as the mechanism within MATSim for modifying network attributes at precise moments during a simulation. Detailed in Section 6.1 of the MATSim textbook [@rieser2016], the implementation of NCE requires specific adjustments to the MATSim configuration file to facilitate a time-variant network. These events can modify a link's free-flow speed, number of lanes, or capacity. To initiate a network change event, the system requires specific information including the time of the event `startTime`, the affected link(s) `link refID`, the type of change `free-flow speed`, `lanes`, or `capacity`, and the value of the change. NCE are the tools used in this study to demonstrate the impact of both incidents and IMT arrivals.

### IMT Assignment and Response {#sec-imt_response}

Within MATSim, the deployment of one or more IMT is triggered by the occurrence of an incident. The optimal IMT for the situation is determined using a least-cost path algorithm, which calculates the quickest route based on real-time traffic conditions like congestion and link speeds. The IMT that can reach the incident location the fastest, accounting for current roadway speeds and congestion, is then dispatched. If all IMT are occupied at the time of an incident, the algorithm waits until an IMT becomes available and then dispatches it to the site of the incident.

When an IMT arrives at an incident within MATSim, a NCE is activated by an event handler, a MATSim tool that logs simulation events as they occur. This NCE demonstrates the IMT's impact by restoring 25% of the link's capacity that was reduced due to the incident. The arrival of each additional IMT unit contributes another 25% to the link's capacity. This approach to capacity adjustment is based on our incident database, which primarily includes incidents where IMT were deployed; in contrast, data on incidents without IMT response was limited. Therefore, the model assumes that IMT involvement leads to capacity improvement, rather than estimating RCT in the absence of IMT intervention. After consultation with UDOT and UHP, we determined that a 25% capacity restoration by each IMT unit is a reasonable estimate for our study, despite the lack of detailed research on the specific effects of IMT on roadway capacity restoration.

@fig-imt_capacity_restore demonstrates the potential impact of an incident lacking IMT intervention, compared with scenarios that include the response of one or two IMT. This illustration highlights the critical role of IMT, showcasing their ability to mitigate incident impacts on network traffic flow.

## Model Implementation in Utah {#sec-model_imp}

To run the MATSim model with the ImtModule extension, a number of input resources are necessary. For the model to function properly, the following are needed:

-   A plans file detailing the agents to be modeled, as well as their activity.
-   A network file with interconnected links, enabling travel for the agents specified in the plans file.
-   A configuration file outlining the scoring metrics of the simulation and establishing parameters pertaining to agent and IMT travel patterns.
-   An IMT file outlining the IMT starting locations and hours of operation.
-   An incidents file containing the necessary data to randomly effect NCE throughout the simulation.

The network and plans files used in this research were developed and calibrated by @lant2021 and @day2022 as part of their research projects studying accessibility and ride-hailing throughout the Wasatch Front. The configuration file used in the model was adapted from the @kaddoura2018 file, which was used for their MATSim incident analysis study. It was slightly modified to accommodate the IMT development, but the parameters they set were largely left unaltered. The IMT file was produced using data provided by UDOT and UHP, as outline in [IMT Setup](#sec-MATSim_mod). The incident data was compiled by @hyer2023 in his research of IMT performance measures and is explained in [Incident Data and Sampling](#sec-inc_data).

### IMT Setup {#sec-IMT_setup}

UDOT currently operates a fleet of 20 IMT, distributed across three zones corresponding to Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah counties within the Wasatch Front. @fig-IMT_Map provides a visual representation of the county boundaries and the initial locations of both existing and newly proposed IMT vehicles used in the simulation.

![IMT starting locations example map.](figures/imt_gray_map.png){#fig-IMT_Map}

In @fig-IMT_Map, circles indicate the locations of existing IMT vehicles, while stars denote the proposed additions. These initial positions are carefully selected to maintain a uniform distribution of IMT vehicles across each county. Typically, IMT vehicles do not cross county borders during operations since dispatch services are organized at the county level. However, our MATSim network does not enforce such restrictions, permitting vehicles to traverse county lines based on the proximity to incidents. The specific starting points are noted in the IMT file as starting links, streamlining their integration into MATSim. IMT are also assigned operational hours, or shifts, which are then programmed into MATSim to represent the units' availability. In Utah, these shifts typically consist of a morning shift beginning at 6:00 AM and an evening shift ending at 10:30 PM. While @fig-IMT_Map showcases the IMT distribution during the evening shift, it is crucial to highlight that IMT distribution remains largely unaltered throughout the morning and afternoon shifts. The initial setup of IMT, although it does not replicate the real-world scenario of drivers beginning their shifts from home, provides a viable solution for our simulations. Considering the significant number of IMT operations along major highways such as I-15, I-80, and I-215, and the daily variations in real-world starting locations, this strategic placement along key routes is justified. In the 30 IMT scenario, all vehicles from the 20 IMT scenarios are retained and augmented with an additional 10 IMT, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all three counties.

Our research primarily concentrates on evaluating the potential impacts of expanding the IMT fleet, rather than examining the effects of their starting positions. We hypothesize that increasing the number of IMT, assuming uniform distribution, will enhance their overall effectiveness.

### Incident Data and Sampling {#sec-inc_data}

@hyer2023 undertook concurrent IMT research and compiled a comprehensive dataset of incidents requiring IMT intervention, drawing on data from the UHP. He carefully ensured the completeness of each incident record in the dataset, capturing crucial details such as the incident start and end times, RCT, location, and extent of capacity reduction.

Analyzing data from 2018 and 2022, @hyer2023 successfully identified 411 unique incidents with varying degrees of severity, ranging from property damage to fatal incidents. We utilized this carefully curated dataset to selectively include specific incidents in the MATSim model. It is important to acknowledge that these 411 incidents only constitute a portion of all incidents reported by UHP during this time frame. A number of additional incidents were excluded from the analysis because they lacked essential information on duration, capacity reduction, or location, all of which are necessary for a comprehensive evaluation. Nevertheless, the integration of the 411 analyzed incidents with the additional incomplete records provides insights, aiding in quantifying the total number of incidents within a specific time period. These combined incident recorded informed the modeling of daily incident frequencies but were not used for incident sampling in the simulation

To generate 10 distinct values representing daily incident frequencies, we employed a randomized sampling technique. These values were collectively termed Current Incident Frequencies as they were derived from the original distribution of daily incidents. Furthermore, we formulated a second set of 10 additional daily incident values, named Increased Incident Frequencies. These values were extracted from the upper portion of the 2022 incident data and were specifically designed to assess the resilience and efficacy of the IMT system under scenarios of markedly increased daily incidents. The visual depiction of the original distribution of daily incidents, alongside the distributions for both the Current and Increased Incident Frequencies, is illustrated in @fig-incident_sampling_plot.

```

In total, twenty values were selected, evenly split with ten allocated to the Current Incident Frequency category, and the remaining ten to the Increased Incident Frequency category. Each value was subsequently paired with a unique three-digit seed number, utilized internally within MATSim to ensure a randomized selection of incidents for each simulation scenario. Following this, we employed the MATSim [Network Change Events](#sec-NCE) to integrate the incidents into the simulation.

### Scenarios {#sec-scenarios}

In [Incident Data and Sampling](#sec-inc_data) and @fig-incident_sampling_plot, we observe the establishment and categorization of twenty distinct incident seeds into either Current or Increased Incident frequencies. Each seed gave rise to three separate simulation groups. The first group, No IMT, exclusively features simulations where incidents occur without any IMT intervention. The second group includes incidents and the deployment of 20 IMT, while the third group features incidents managed by 30 IMT.

In total, six scenario groups, each with 10 random "days" with distinct incident sets, were established, as follows:

-   No IMT, current incident frequency
-   No IMT, increased incident frequency
-   20 IMT, current incident frequency
-   20 IMT, increased incident frequency
-   30 IMT, current incident frequency
-   30 IMT, increased incident frequency

It is important to note, as described in the [IMT setup](#sec-IMT_setup) section, that not all IMT vehicles are operational simultaneously. Due to scheduling constraints, the actual number of IMT on the road at any given time is typically half of the total fleet size.

Scenarios are compared according to their IMT group and against a baseline scenario that assumes no incidents or IMT intervention. The primary metrics for traffic impact analysis in this study is vehicle hours of delay (VHD) and RT. To calculate the average VHD per group, we sum the delays in each scenario and then divide by the number of scenarios in the group, which is ten, as shown in @eq-vhd_group:

$$
\text{Average VHD per group} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} D_i}{10}
$$ {#eq-vhd_group} where $D_i$ represents the VHD for the $i^{th}$ scenario. VHD in each group were analyzed at three levels: Network Links, Motorway Links, and Impacted Links. Network Links provide a macroscopic view of the network-wide delay. Motorway Links focus on major highways and freeways, offering insight into the performance of critical transportation arteries. Impacted Links give a microscopic view of the delays at the incident sites and their immediate upstream links. This tiered approach ensures a comprehensive analysis, capturing both the overarching impact on traffic flow and the specific effects in critical areas affected by incidents.

In addition to VHD, the study investigates the performance and operational efficiency of IMT. Metrics such as the average travel times, travel distances, and incident RT are compared across the 20 IMT and 30 IMT groups. This, in turn, informs strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and deployment, ensuring that IMT vehicles are optimally utilized to mitigate traffic delays and enhance roadway safety.
